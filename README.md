You can visit the application [here] (https://guess-number-8899b.web.app/).
To play, you need to register (if you are not registered) or enter (if you are registered).
Description of the application.
1. Enter a number from 1 to 99.
2. Press confirm or reset if you want to change the number.
3. Click START GAME or reset if you want to change the number.
4. The computer generates a random number that is different from the number you entered.
5. Using the plus and minus buttons, you need to help the computer guess the number. If the number you entered is greater than the random number of the generated computer, click the plus button; otherwise, click the minus button.
6. Then, after clicking the plus or minus button, the computer will generate the next random number. This number will be more or less than the previous number, depending on which button was pressed: plus or minus.
7. After the computer guesses your number, the number of guessing attempts, the number you entered, and the NEW GAME button will appear.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
